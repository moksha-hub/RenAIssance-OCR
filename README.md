###Note: I am not TrOCR centric you can use any But moto is to get >80% accuracy.
Here's a focused explanation of your task:

## Hybrid OCR Model for 17th Century Spanish Text

### Core Requirements
- Create a hybrid transformer-based model (VIT-TF, CNN-TF, or VIT-RNN) for text recognition
- Primary goal: Achieve >80% OCR accuracy
- Secondary goal: Make it lightweight for low computational resources (T4 GPU in Colab free tier)(optional try only if possible or fine if model isnt light weight)
- Implement language modeling for contextual corrections based on 17th-century Spanish grammar

### Dataset Options
- SANR (Spanish Archive of Notarial Records) for handwritten text (optional), take any dataset
- Any appropriate dataset for both printed and handwritten 17th-century Spanish text

### Model Implementation
- Vision Transformer front-end to process document images
- Transformer decoder to convert visual features to text
- Fine-tune on 17th-century Spanish documents (both printed and handwritten)


### Post-Processing
- Implement language model trained on 17th-century Spanish texts
- Add contextual correction based on period-specific grammar rules


Thank You.
