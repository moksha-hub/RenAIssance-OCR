# Trocr-model
historical Spanish handwritten text from the 17th century   using the SANR dataset for this purpose.

Your Project: Fine-tuning TrOCR for 17th-Century Spanish Handwriting Recognition
You are fine-tuning the TrOCR model (Transformer-based OCR) using the SANR dataset on ##**Google Colab free tier**##  only to recognize 17th-century Spanish handwritten text.

🛠️ Project Breakdown
1️⃣ Dataset: SANR (Spanish Archive of Notarial Records)
Contains handwritten Spanish text from the 17th century.
Hosted on GitHub, loaded into Google Colab.
Likely requires preprocessing due to handwriting variations.
2️⃣ Model: TrOCR (Transformer OCR)
A VisionEncoderDecoderModel combining:
ViT (Vision Transformer) Encoder → Extracts image features.
TrOCR Decoder → Converts features to text.
Pretrained on printed/handwritten datasets but needs fine-tuning for historical Spanish text.

I want to fine-tune the TrOCR model for 17th-century Spanish handwritten text recognition, ensuring it runs efficiently on low-computation environments (like Google Colab but not strictly limited to it).

primary goal is to achieve >80% accuracy while keeping the model lightweight and optimized.

I need step-by-step guidance to:

Train the model efficiently.
Test & evaluate its performance.
Deploy the final model for real-world handwritten text recognition.

I hope this would help you i need this project to be done quickly.. code 
you can checkout in Trocr.py
